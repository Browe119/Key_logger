# Key_logger
This is a simple Python keylogger built using the pynput library. It captures keyboard input and logs the keys pressed into a text file (`keylog.txt`). The program writes keystrokes in batches for efficiency and handles special keys like Space, Enter, Backspace, and modifiers with readable tags.
